# periodictable

An periodic table app made in flutter.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

* You need to have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install to install Flutter.
* You also need to have a code editor installed. Visual Studio Code is a popular choice, but you can use any code editor that you like.

**Clone the repository**

The first step is to clone the repository from GitHub. You can do this using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/AvikArefin/periodictable.git
```

This will create a directory called `periodictable` in your current working directory.

**Open the project in your code editor**

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the project in your code editor. Visual Studio Code users can open the project by double-clicking the `periodictable.code-workspace` file.

**Run the project**

To run the project, you can use the following command:

```
flutter run
```

This will launch options in your terminal (if you do not have android / windows setup it will directly run on your default browser. See disclaimer).

**The periodictable project**

The `periodictable` project is a simple Flutter project that displays a table of the elements. The project is divided into one main file:

* `main.dart` - This file contains the code that launches the application.

The `main.dart` file uses the Material Design: https://material.io/ library to create a table of the elements. The table is divided into rows and columns, and each row represents a group of elements. The columns represent the atomic number, symbol, name, and atomic mass of each element.
